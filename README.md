# textgridR
An R package that reads in Praat TextGrid annotations so that they can be manipulated as R objects.

Note: I wrote this about 4 years ago at this point (7/20/17) and I don't regularly maintain it anymore (since I'm out of the psycholinguistics business 
and now in the library IT business).  It was a nice project that helped me keep up my R chops for a time and not get too rusty.

For packages that are likely better maintained, check out:
